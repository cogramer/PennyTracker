#Functionality
-
In the main menu

- `2. Create new table`: Add a new table to track finances
- `3. Remove table(s)`: Delete an existing table
- `4. Clear screen`: Refresh the display
- `5. Exit program`: Close PennyTracker
- NOTE: You may see a table named `sqlite_sequence` after you create your first table. This table is automatically generated by SQLite and is used to manage the row ID numbers of every other table that you have created.

- `1. Add new row(s)`: Update your table with new records
- `2. Remove row(s)`: Remove records from your table
- `3. Graph`: Graph a bar plot based on which records you chose to have displayed

- NOTES:
  - Date Format: When entering a record’s date, follow the format YYYY MM DD (e.g., 2025 3 12).
  - Selecting Rows for Update/Deletion:
      - You will be prompted with `Enter the IDs of rows involved (comma-separated, use '->' for ranges): `.
      - Example input: 1, 2, 3, 5->9, 12, 13
      - This is equivalent to selecting: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13
